Lab - Notifications: Instructions
====
In this lab you will experiment with User Notifications, BroadcastReceivers, AsyncTasks and Networking.

You will create a simple application that downloads and displays tweets. After completing this lab you should better understand how Android uses AsyncTasks to perform work off the main Thread, how BroadcastReceivers allow components to listen for and react to events, and how User Notifications allow apps to inform users about the app's behavior.
